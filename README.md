# MITx-6.00.1x
This is a place where I will upload my code for the problem sets in the MIT XSeries 6.001x course of Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, from EdX. I have included some other code of probles that I have found most challenging as well.

All of the code I have uploaded uses Python 3.x.

This was done Jan-Mar 2021.
